# first-game
This Python script simulates a simple dice game designed for 2 to 4 players. Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die to accumulate points. The objective is to reach or exceed a score of 50 points without rolling a 1. Rolling a 1 resets the player's score for that turn to zero and ends their turn immediately.
